// Configuration bits: selected in the GUI

//CONFIG1
#pragma config FEXTOSC = OFF     // External Oscillator mode selection bits->Oscillator not enabled
#pragma config RSTOSC = HFINTOSC_1MHz     // Power-up default value for COSC bits->HFINTOSC (1MHz)
#pragma config CLKOUTEN = OFF     // Clock Out Enable bit->CLKOUT function is disabled; i/o or oscillator function on OSC2
#pragma config CSWEN = ON     // Clock Switch Enable bit->Writing to NOSC and NDIV is allowed
#pragma config VDDAR = LO     // VDD Range Analog Calibration Selection bit->Internal analog systems are calibrated for operation between VDD = 1.8 - 3.6V
#pragma config FCMEN = ON     // Fail-Safe Clock Monitor Enable bit->Fail-Safe Clock Monitor enabled

//CONFIG2
#pragma config MCLRE = EXTMCLR     // Master Clear Enable bit->If LVP = 0, MCLR pin is MCLR; If LVP = 1, RA3 pin function is MCLR
#pragma config PWRTS = PWRT_OFF     // Power-up Timer Selection bits->PWRT is disabled
#pragma config DACAUTOEN = OFF     // DAC Buffer Automatic Range Select Enable bit->DAC Buffer reference range is determined by the REFRNG bit
